  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]

  delegation {
    name = "${var.prefix}-databricks-del"

    service_delegation {

  - **virtual_network_name**: The name of the virtual network to which the subnet belongs.
  - **address_prefixes**: The address range for the subnet.
  - **delegation**: This block delegates the subnet to a specific service.
    - **name**: The name of the delegation.
    - **service_delegation**: This block specifies the service delegation details.
      - **actions**: The actions allowed for the service delegation.

#### Usage

To use this script, you need to have Terraform installed and configured with your Azure credentials. You can then run the following commands:

1. Initialize the Terraform configuration:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. Plan the Terraform deployment:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the Terraform deployment:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

#### Cost

The cost associated with this script depends on the resources created and their usage. The primary cost factors include:

- **Virtual Network**: Charges for data transfer and network usage.
- **Subnets**: No direct cost, but associated resources (e.g., VMs, Databricks) incur costs.
- **Databricks Workspace**: Charges based on the SKU selected and usage.

For detailed pricing information, refer to the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/).

#### Potential Risks

1. **Misconfiguration**: Incorrect configuration can lead to security vulnerabilities or service disruptions.
2. **Cost Overruns**: Unmonitored usage can lead to unexpected costs.
3. **Network Security**: Ensure proper network security rules and policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Service Limits**: Be aware of Azure service limits and quotas to avoid deployment failures.

For more information on best practices and potential risks, refer to the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/).
